# Charn

"It is silent now. But I have stood here when the whole air was full of the
 noises of Charn; the trampling of feet, the creaking of wheels, the cracking of
 the whips and the groaning of slaves, the thunder of chariots, and the
 sacrificial drums beating in the temples. I have stood here (but that was near
 the end) when the roar of battle went up from every street and the river of
 Charn ran red. All in one moment one woman blotted it out for ever.‚Äù
